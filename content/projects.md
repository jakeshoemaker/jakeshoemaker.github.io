## *House Price Predictor*
### A Machine learning program that classifies a house's price
---
[House Classifier](https://github.com/jakeshoemaker/house-classifier) is my first full scale machine learning project. It felt like I was drinking from a firehose when coding this but I learned so much! Some of the key things I learned about were:
    
* Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines
* Fine Tuning Models
* Building infastructure for Machine Learning Code
* The importance of having a balanced test-set

## *Plant Doctor*
### A full stack IoT app made with &#10084;
---
[Plant Doctor](https://github.com/jakeshoemaker/plantDoctor) is a Website I created in order to monitor the moisture of my plant. The idea came to me when, for the third day in a row, I had forgotten to water my plant!

I am creating a web site where you can monitor the health of any plant! 
- never forget to water your plant (or remember that it doesnt need any more water)
- the application will be configurable to report on more than one plant, if needed

## Technologies used
- react.js 
- node.js & express
- python - for data collection and sqlite
- docker
- sqlite

## Hardware Used 
- Rasberry Pi 4 - collects data and is my server
- Grove Sensor & Hat
- a plant that likes water ( pretty much any plant ... ah maybe not a cactus tho..)
